    <p>After playing as a child artist in Vijetha (1985) and as a dancer in Daddy (2001), he made his adult debut in Gangotri.[22] The film was directed by K. Raghavendra Rao with his father Allu Aravind producing, along with C. Ashwini Dutt.[23] Praising his acting performance, Jeevi of Idlebrain criticised his looks in the film and added that "Arjun should choose roles that amplify his strength and nullify his weaknesses."[24] He then appeared in Sukumar's Arya.[25] He plays the eponymous lead, an outgoing and free-spirited boy falling in love with Geetha (Anu Mehta), an introverted girl who is on the shield of another person Ajay (Siva Balaji).[26] The film proved to be his breakthrough, earning a first nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu and won the Nandi Special Jury Award and the CineMAA Award for Best Actor (Critics).[27] The film was a critical and commercial success,[28] grossing over ₹30 crore,[29] with a production budget of ₹4 crore.[30] In 2006, the film was dubbed and released in Malayalam in Kerala.

Karunakaran's musical love story Happy.[35][36] The film did well at the box-office especially in the overseas markets.[37] A critic appreciated his dancing skills and performance, but felt that his character is a typical happy-go-lucky guy.[38]In 2014, he appeared in a cameo role in Vamsi Paidipally's action thriller film Yevadu, alongside Kajal Aggarwal.[72][73] Y. Sunita Chowdary of The Hindu, in her review, wrote that "Allu Arjun shows what an actor can do even in a short role, in the few minutes he packs his experience, internalises the character and makes an impressive exit even as he loses his identity."[74] His next film was Surender Reddy's Race Gurram, in which he played Allu Lakshman "Lucky" Prasad, a carefree guy.[75] He joined the production of the film in May 2013.[76] The film was successful at the box office, with the film being Allu's first ₹100 crore grosser.[77] Writing to Deccan Chronicle, Suresh Kavirayani felt that Allu Arjun steals the show with his energetic performance and also praised his dancing skills in the film.[78] Ranjani Rajendra too praised his dance moves, comic acting and performance in the action sequences, but felt that the story is predictable and routine.[79] For his performance, he won his third Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu[80] and was nominated for the SIIMA Award for Best Actor – Telugu for the second time after Julayi. Allu Arjun produced and acted in a short film I Am That Change, which was released in August 2014. The film was directed by Sukumar,[81] to spread awareness on individual social responsibility.

        His next film was Bhaskar's Parugu, where he played the role of Krishna, a happy-go-lucky man from Hyderabad who helps his friend to elope with his love, only to experience the wrath of the woman's father and the emotional struggle he felt. Idlebrain wrote: "Allu Arjun is pretty excellent in the first half as the characterization in the first half is vibrant and needs loads of energy. He carried the entire first half on his shoulders. He excelled in the emotional scenes in the second half."[41] Writing for Rediff.com, Radhikha Rajamani stated that "Arjun performs well though he is rather subdued."[42] Allu Arjun won his first Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu and his second Nandi Special Jury Award.
        
        Allu Arjun next appeared in Trivikram Srinivas's S/O Satyamurthy (2015), which was released on 9 April 2015.[84] The film was a commercial success, with critics praising his performance.[85][86] His performance in the film earned him his seventh nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu.

He also won three other awards for his performance, including Nandi Award for Best Character Actor.

In 2016, he acted in Sarrainodu, directed by Boyapati Srinu.[93] Although the film received negative reviews for the screenplay and story,[94][95] it was a major commercial success at the box office, grossing over ₹127.6 crore.[96] Allu Arjun called it as a "landmark film" in his career.[97] His performance in the action scenes and dance numbers was praised.[98] HIs performance in the film won him the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor – Telugu, in addition to his eighth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu.

Firstpost's Hemanth Kumar praised his dance and wrote that "look beyond Allu Arjun's classy moves in Seeti Maar and Asmaika Yoga, all you find is a story that struggles to find its rhythm."[102] India Today too lauded his dance but criticised the film's screenplay and called it "Boring-ah, bore-asya, bore-obiah".[103]

Allu Arjun next starred in Sukumar's action comedy Arya 2.

The film revolved around the complexities of love–hate relationships and love triangles.[43] His character in the film had shades of grey.[44] Sify wrote that "Allu Arjun is full of energy as the guy caught in the powerful current of love. Though he plays the part with negative shades, his characterization could evoke a lot of sympathy from the audiences. His dances are mind-blowing and he excels in emotional scenes."[45] Oneindia appreciated his dance moves and acting performances, especially the comedy scenes.[46] He received his fourth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu for his performance in the film.

   <p>He next appeared in V. V. Vinayak's action film Badrinath (2011), in which he played the role of Badri, a modern-day Indian samurai who is assigned to protect the Badrinath Temple by his Guru (Prakash Raj), to whom he is very loyal.[57] Allu Arjun undertook intensive martial arts and sword fighting training in Vietnam[58][59] and marks his first pairing with Tamannaah.[60] He grew his hair out for his look as a warrior in the film.[citation needed] It his second A-rated film in India after Vedam (2010), on the account of graphic action violence.[61] The film completed a 50-day run in 187 cinemas.[62] His performance and character received mixed reviews.[63][64] A critic of The Times of India wrote that "Arjun hardly has any scope to emote as he was mostly pushed into action scenes and song sequences."[65]

    After Badrinath, he signed Trivikram Srinivas's action comedy film Julayi in 2011.[66] It was released in 2012, in which he played the role of Ravindra Narayan, a street-smart yet spoilt brat whose life takes a drastic turn after he becomes the witness of a huge bank robbery. A critic wrote that "Allu Arjun puts in a confident performance as the loveable rogue. It's a role that is right up his alley and he carries it off with a characteristic panache. He lights up the screen with his dancing in particular, pulling off some pretty challenging dance moves."[67] Riya Chakravarty of NDTV, in her review, stated that "Arjun has delivered an outstanding performance."[68] He was nominated for the SIIMA Award for Best Actor – Telugu, for his performance in the film.
    
    The next year, he starred in Puri Jagannadh's action thriller Iddarammayilatho, playing Sanju Reddy, a guitarist with a dark past, alongside Amala Paul and Catherine Tresa. Sangeetha Devi Dundoo of The Hindu praised his performance in the action sequences and dance moves in various songs in the film, adding "Allu Arjun uses his agility to his advantage in dances and stunt episodes".[69] Another critic wrote that "True to his tag of "stylish star", Allu Arjun looks trendier than ever before. His character of a guitarist, who is a street performer in Barcelona, was at its best sketchy, and looks completely different from his previous films. He once again proves that he is a good actor and probably because of the action director's meticulous planning, he makes perfect expressions in all the fight scenes."[70][71] The film marks his second and last collaboration, with Puri Jagannadh after Desamuduru (2007).
